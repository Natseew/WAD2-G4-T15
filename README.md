# NeverAlone

Welcome to the **NeverAlone** GitHub repository! This project is a socially-focused dating application designed to foster deeper, meaningful connections, moving away from surface-level interactions to combat the loneliness epidemic often exacerbated by dating apps.

## Project Overview

The app aims to address common user pain points, such as shallow conversations, cluttered interfaces, and limited interaction opportunities. Our solution combines intuitive design, enhanced filters, engaging quiz games, and options that go beyond traditional dating to create genuine connections.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Filters and Options**: Provides granular filters allowing users to specify what they are looking for, whether friendship or romance, and select partners based on shared values and interests.
- **Quiz Games**: Includes interactive quiz games to help users learn more about their matches in a fun, engaging way.
- **Compatibility Focus (Love is Blind)**: Emphasizes compatibility and shared values, moving beyond superficial traits.

## Solution Architecture

The architecture is built to support a responsive, seamless experience on both frontend and backend platforms.

### Frontend
